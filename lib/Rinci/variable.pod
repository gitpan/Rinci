=head1 SPECIFICATION

There is currently no metadata properties specific to variables.

Specify the Sah schema that the variable's value must validate to. This can be
used by a variable wrapper (getter/setter generator) tool to make sure that
variable always contains valid values.

Example:

 # metadata for variable $Meaning_Of_Life
 {
     ...
     summary => 'The meaning of life',
     schema => [int => {between => [1, 100]},
 }
